        <h1>Back For Good</h1>
        <h3>by Take That</h3>
        <p>
            I guess now it's time for me to give up<br>
            I feel it's time<br>
            Got a picture of you beside me<br>
            Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup<br>
            Oh yeah<br>
            Got a fist of pure emotion<br>
            Got a head of shattered dreams<br>
            Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever I said, whatever I did<br>
            I didn't mean it<br>
            I just want you back for good<br>
            (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            Whenever I'm wrong<br>
            Just tell me the song and I'll sing it<br>
            You'll be right and understood<br>
            (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            I want you back for good
        </p>
        <p>
            Unaware but underlined<br>
            I figured out this story (no no)<br>
            It wasn't good (no no)<br>
            But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)<br>
            I celebrated glory<br>
            But that was not to be<br>
            In the twist of separation<br>
            You excelled at being free<br>
            Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever I said, whatever I did<br>
            I didn't mean it<br>
            I just want you back for good<br>
            (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good<br>
            Whenever I'm wrong<br>
            Just tell me the song and I'll sing it<br>
            You'll be right and understood<br>
            (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            I want you back for good
        </p>
        <p>
            And we'll be together<br>
            This time is forever (forever)<br>
            We'll be fighting, and forever we will be<br>
            So complete in our love<br>
            We will never be uncovered again
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever I said, whatever I did<br>
            I didn't mean it<br>
            I just want you back for good<br>
            (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            Whenever I'm wrong<br>
            Just tell me the song and I'll sing it<br>
            You'll be right and understood<br>
            (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            See, I want you back for good
        </p>
        <p>
            And we'll be together<br>
            This time is forever (forever)<br>
            We'll be fighting, and forever we will be<br>
            So complete in our love<br>
            We will never be uncovered again
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever I said, whatever I did<br>
            I didn't mean it<br>
            I just want you back for good<br>
            (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            Whenever I'm wrong<br>
            Just tell me the song and I'll sing it<br>
            You'll be right and understood<br>
            (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            See, I want you back for good
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever I said, whatever I did<br>
            I didn't mean it<br>
            I just want you back for good<br>
            (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good<br>
            Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)<br>
            Just tell me the song and I'll sing it<br>
            You'll be right and understood<br>
            I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)<br>
            See, I want you back for good<br>
            Oh yeah
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess now it's time that you came back for good
