    <p>I guess now it's time for me to give up</p>
    <p>I feel it's time</P>
    <p>Got a picture of you beside me</P>
    <p>Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup</P>
    <p>Oh yeah</p>
    <p>Got a fist of pure emotion</p>
    <p>Got a head of shattered dreams</P>
    <p>Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now</p>
    <p>Whatever I said, whatever I did</p>
    <p>I didn't mean it</p>
    <p>I just want you back for good</P>
    <p>(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)</p>
    <p>Whenever I'm wrong</p>
    <p>Just tell me the song and I'll sing it</p>
    <p>You'll be right and understood</p>
    <p>(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)</p>
    <p>I want you back for good</p>
    <p>Unaware but underlined<p>
    <p>I figured out this story (no no)</p>
    <p>It wasn't good (no no)</p>
    <p>But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)</p>
    <p>I celebrated glory</p>
    <p>But that was not to be</p>
    <p>In the twist of separation</p>
    <p>You excelled at being free</p>
    <p>Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me</p>
    <p>Whatever I said, whatever I did</p>
    <p>I didn't mean it</p>
    <p>I just want you back for good</p>
    <p>(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) See, I want you back for good</p>
    <p>Whenever I'm wrong</p>
    <p>Just tell me the song and I'll sing it</p>
    <p>You'll be right and understood</p>
    <p>(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)</p>
    <p>I want you back for good</p>
    <p>And we'll be together</p>
    <p>This time is forever (forever)</p>
    <p>We'll be fighting, and forever we will be</p>
    <p>So complete in our love</p>
    <p>We will never be uncovered again</p>
    <p>Whatever I said, whatever I did</p>
    <p>I didn't mean it</p>
    <p>I just want you back for good</p>
    <p>(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)</p>
    <p>Whenever I'm wrong</p>
    <p>Just tell me the song and I'll sing it</p>
    <p>You'll be right and understood</p>
    <p>(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)</p>
    <p>See, I want you back for good</p>
    <p>Whatever I said, whatever I did</p>
    <p>I didn't mean it</p>
    <p>I just want you back for good</p>
    <p>(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good</p>
    <p>Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)</p>
    <p>Just tell me the song and I'll sing it</p>
    <p>You'll be right and understood</p>
    <p>I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)</p>
    <p>See, I want you back for good</p>
    <p>Oh yeah</p>
    <p>I guess now it's time that you came back for good</p>
